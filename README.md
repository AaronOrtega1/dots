# README for easy install

This is a README to have an idea of what to install when starting a new computer configuration.

## Install

For the symbolic links to work, the repository should be cloned in the home directory.

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/AaronOrtega1/dots.git
```

Please install the following packages:

```bash
Pacman -S stow
```

This will allow the symbolic links to be created.
